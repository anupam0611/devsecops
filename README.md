# DevSecOps Pipeline

This repository contains a comprehensive DevSecOps pipeline that implements various security measures throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Security Features

1. **Code Security**
   - Bandit for Python code security analysis
   - Safety for dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Snyk for additional vulnerability scanning

2. **Container Security**
   - Trivy for container vulnerability scanning
   - Docker best practices implementation
   - Image scanning on push

3. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Terraform for Infrastructure as Code
   - tfsec for Terraform security scanning
   - AWS security best practices

4. **Runtime Security**
   - AWS ECS with security groups
   - Container runtime security
   - Network security controls

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- AWS account with appropriate credentials
- Snyk account and API token
- Docker installed locally for development

## Required Secrets

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `SNYK_TOKEN`

## Pipeline Stages

1. **Security Scan**
   - Code security analysis
   - Dependency scanning
   - Vulnerability assessment

2. **Container Scan**
   - Docker image build
   - Container vulnerability scanning
   - Image security validation

3. **Infrastructure Scan**
   - Terraform configuration validation
   - Infrastructure security checks
   - Compliance verification

4. **Deployment**
   - AWS infrastructure deployment
   - Application deployment
   - Post-deployment verification

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository
2. Add required secrets to your GitHub repository
3. Push changes to trigger the pipeline
4. Monitor the pipeline execution in GitHub Actions

## Security Best Practices

- Regular dependency updates
- Security scanning in CI/CD
- Infrastructure as Code
- Container security
- Runtime protection
- Compliance monitoring
